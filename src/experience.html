                        <p>
                            During my current rotation at General Motors, I've designed and developed a Python-based full-stack internal web application that is used daily by a seven-person 
                            analyst team to support real-time multi-user data entry, centralized task tracking, and streamlined workflows. I migrated a legacy Excel-based system containing 
                            over 20,000 records to a cloud-hosted MySQL database, improving data scalability, reliability, and accessibility. Throughout a secondary assignment, I 
                            analyzed and refactored core system logic to eliminate inefficiencies and reduce processing errors, ultimately enhancing overall operational performance and 
                            usability for end users.

                        <p>
                            During my internship, I developed a Python-based algorithm to identify and remove outdated GeoTile files from vehicle computers, improving system performance, 
                            optimizing storage utilization, and supporting automated driving functionality. I planned and executed comprehensive test plans to ensure the algorithm met 
                            both coding and company standards before deployment. Throughout the project, I collaborated cross-functionally with developers from multiple teams to 
                            successfully integrate new functionality into existing systems and workflows.

                            During my internship, I contributed to several server-side development projects involving web applications, Flask APIs, and database design. I led the 
                            development of a C++-based back-end testing environment used by over 200 developers to support internal tooling and improve development workflows. In 
                            addition, I developed automotive software solutions using both C++ and Python, gaining hands-on experience building reliable and scalable systems for 
                            production environments.

                            During my internship, I collaborated with senior developers on project research and technology selection to support informed design decisions.
                            I prepared presentation materials for client meetings that highlighted system designs and architectural concepts, helping communicate technical 
                            ideas clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I also assisted in developing cloud-based software as part of a 
                            company-wide migration from on-premise servers, gaining experience in modern infrastructure and large-scale system transitions.
