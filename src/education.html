                                This course served as the introductory framework for our Software Engineering curriculum, establishing the foundational
                                principles that are expected from our education at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). The focal point of this 
                                course entailed engaging in a semester-long group project, consisting of 4-5 team members, dedicated to developing an 
                                online web checkers game while closely mirroring the typical software project lifecycle observed in industry settings. 
                                Each participant was assigned key roles that mirror real-world scenarios, such as project owner, scrum master, and 
                                developer. The course also emphasized the importance of conducting daily stand-up meetings within our teams, structuring 
                                and executing sprints, crafting user stories, estimating story points, and effectively managing our project backlog. In 
                                conclusion, this course delivered valuable insights into the practical aspects of project development, mirroring the daily 
                                experiences of software engineers in industry.

                                This course provided a comprehensive overview of the responsibilities and knowledge required to excel as a full-stack software 
                                engineer, encompassing proficiency in backend, frontend, and database development. Through the introduction to database systems, 
                                I gained my initial exposure to SQL, enabling me to perform tasks such as data insertion, deletion, and modification. These 
                                skills subsequently proved invaluable during my internship at General Motors, a year later. Additionally, the course exposed me 
                                to the utilization and creation of REST APIs, serving as a vital conduit between database information and frontend presentation. 
                                Over the duration of the course, I not only expanded upon my preexisting skills in Python and HTML but also acquired new 
                                competencies in technologies like React, PostgreSQL, and REST APIs.

                                In contrast to my prior experiences with software engineering courses at my university, this particular course stands out due to its 
                                predominant focus on the software design aspect, as opposed to the mere implementation of code. Throughout the course, we delved 
                                deeply into the realms of design and the utilization of the Unified Modeling Language (UML), with a particular emphasis on the 
                                preeminence of design before embarking on the implementation phase. The curriculum seamlessly integrated essential design principles, 
                                encompassing sequence diagrams, as well as design patterns like composite, mediator, and proxy, which are widely employed in industry 
                                for the purpose of structuring and architecting project systems. This course has significantly broadened my perspective on software 
                                engineering, highlighting the fact that it entails more than simply writing code and hoping for functional outcomes, but rather 
                                necessitates meticulous system design tailored to the specific requirements of the software.

                                This class marked my inaugural exposure to embedded systems and my initial foray into the high-level utilization of the C programming
                                language within a project context. The primary emphasis of this course centered on the development of a semester-long project, 
                                involving the creation of an MP3 player using a Nucleo board in conjunction with a breadboard and MIDI files. Throughout the course 
                                duration, we received comprehensive instruction in embedded programming, including extensive coverage of topics such as structs, 
                                pointers, bitwise operations, and the System Timer. These concepts were seamlessly integrated to construct a functional system capable 
                                of parsing MIDI files and rendering songs through speakers. These acquired skills have significantly contributed to the foundation of 
                                my knowledge in embedded systems, proving invaluable during my subsequent internship at General Motors, where I actively engaged with 
                                automotive systems.
